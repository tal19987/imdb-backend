This project came to my mind as i wass sitting on the couch and try to choose a movie from a list of movies on the VOD.   
There was no rating scale for the movies and i had to go to imdb and check each movie by my self.  
This is why i was thinking to create this simple web app.  

Server side using **Python & Flask** ;  
Frontend side using **React and Bootstrap** ;  

I also using- **AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD, Unit Testing, Jenkins, DockerHub** etc for the Pipeline.
