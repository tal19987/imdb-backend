This project came to my mind as i wass sitting on the couch and try to choose a movie from a list of movies on the VOD.   
There was no rating scale for the movies and i had to go to imdb and check each movie by my self.  
This is why i was thinking to create this simple web app.  

Server side using ** Python & Flask **;  
Frontend side using ** React * Bootstrap **;  

I also using- ** AWS, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Unit Testing, Jenkins** etc for the Pipeline.
